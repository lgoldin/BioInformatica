# * Long hematopoietin receptor, single chain family signature *
# **************************************************************
# 
# A number  of  receptors  for  lymphokines,  hematopoietic  growth  factors and
# growth hormone-related  molecules  have  been  found to share a common binding
# domain. These  receptors  are  designated as hematopoietin receptors [1,2] and
# the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been
# subdivided into  two  major  structural  groups:  Large/long  and  small/short
# hematopoietins.
# 
# Several receptor  chains  for  large  hematopoietins  are structurally related
# such that  their  extracellular  parts  strictly  contain  the 200 amino-acids
# hematopoietin domain,   duplicated  in  the  thrombopoietin  receptor  and  in
# avian prolactin receptors. This subgroup of receptor chains contains:
# 
#  - Growth hormone receptor (GHR).
#  - Prolactin receptor (PRLR).
#  - Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR).
#  - Thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR).
# 
# A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:

#    | |       |  |                      Transmembrane
#    +-+       +--+
# 
# These receptor  chains  are  single  components of receptors that homodimerize
# upon binding   of   the  cognate  cytokine,  following  the  structural  model
# described for the growth hormone-receptor complex [3].
# 
# We have  used  one  pattern to detect this family. The motif is located in the
# carboxy-terminal part of the 200 amino acid hematopoietin domain.
